# Pointer-Basics-in-CPP

##**AIM**: To study about basics of pointer in C++

##**THEORY**:

<p>In C++, pointers are variables that store the memory addresses of other variables.If there a variable 'var' in the program, '&var' will give us its address in the memory.We can call a pointer in the program either by its value or reference(discussed later).</p>

##**Syntax**: (data type)(*variable name)

<p>Some advantages of using pointers:<br>
(i) Pointers make the programs simple and reduce their length.<br>
(ii) Pointers are helpful in allocation and de-allocation of memory during the execution of the program.<br>
(iii) Pointers enhance the execution speed of a program, etc.</p>

##**ALGORITHM**: To display a pointer value and its address<br>
step1: define a pointer such as int *var1 and a variable int var2<br>
step2: assign an int value to var2<br>
step3: assign address of var2 to var1 (var1=&var2)<br>
step3: display the value of the variable by using pointer(*var1)<br>
step4: display the address (var1)
